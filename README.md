## Methodology
1. For each case study:
   - Extracted relevant parameters from case study data
   - Implemented a specific fitness function
   - Conducted parameter sweeps to find optimal GA configuration
   - Analyzed convergence behavior

2. Comparative analysis:
   - Compared convergence rates across case studies
   - Analyzed parameter sensitivity
   - Identified patterns in optimal configurations
